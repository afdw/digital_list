An implementation and a proof of a purely
functional data structure that combines the benefits of a
list and an array. Everything is done in Coq and then
extracted in OCaml. Dependent types are used to guide
the thinking process, get a shorter development and more
efficient extraction.

Source code in Coq: [theories](theories).

Extraction to OCaml: [extraction](extraction).
